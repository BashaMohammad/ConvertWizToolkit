# 1. FIX FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION & SESSION
- Validate and ensure the following Firebase configuration keys are correctly set in `firebase-config.js`:
  - FIREBASE_API_KEY
  - FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
  - FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
  - FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
  - FIREBASE_APP_ID
  - FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
- Update `login.js` to:
  - Use `signInWithEmailAndPassword` and provide clear error messages for invalid credentials.
  - On successful login, save auth state in localStorage and redirect to `dashboard.html`.
- Update `dashboard.js` to:
  - Implement `onAuthStateChanged` listener to validate session and redirect unauthenticated users back to `login.html`.
  - On logout, call `signOut` and clear localStorage/session tokens.
- Add console logging for auth state changes for debugging.

# 2. FIX DASHBOARD SCREEN SWITCHING
- Repair menu event handlers in `dashboard.js`:
  - Ensure correct section switching without breaking current UI layout.
  - Add missing `querySelector` bindings for dashboard sections, admin panel, and any other tool pages.
- Fix cases where sections remain hidden or UI breaks on navigation.

# 3. UI ENHANCEMENTS (NO DESIGN CHANGE)
- Ensure the gradient background remains consistent across login and dashboard pages.
- Fix banner placeholders in the dashboard (ensure AdSense placeholders are not broken).
- Improve mobile responsiveness:
  - Adjust CSS for tool cards and banner alignment in `dashboard.css` (use media queries if necessary).
- Do NOT alter colors, structure, or theme — only fix alignment.

# 4. ADD AUTOMATED TEST CASES
- Create `auth-tests.js` with the following automated checks:
  - Test 1: Login with valid test credentials (email/password from env or test-config.js) → Expect dashboard.html redirect.
  - Test 2: Login with invalid password → Expect error message displayed on login page.
  - Test 3: Attempt direct access to dashboard.html without login → Expect redirect to login.html.
  - Test 4: After login, refresh dashboard → Expect session persistence and no redirect.
  - Test 5: Logout from dashboard → Expect redirect to login.html.

# 5. TEST RUN
- Add a test runner script in `package.json` as:
  "scripts": {
     "test-auth": "node auth-tests.js"
  }
- Execute `npm run test-auth` after all fixes to validate:
  - All authentication flows.
  - Dashboard screen access and transitions.
  - UI element visibility checks.

# 6. POST VALIDATION
- Confirm console logs show no Firebase errors on login/dashboard pages.
- Ensure that the dashboard screen is fully accessible after login and that navigation works without glitches.

# 7. FINAL NOTE
- Do not make any visual or functional changes to components unrelated to login/dashboard.
- Prepare for the next phase: PayPal and Razorpay integration after this fix is validated.
