# OBJECTIVE:
Perform full SEO validation across all pages in convertwiz.in and blog.convertwiz.in.
Replit must NOT change the UI, gradients, or layouts unless explicitly asked.

---

# 1. VALIDATION CHECKS
Replit must validate the following for every page (tools + blogs):

1. **Meta Tags**
   - Each page has a unique <title> (50–60 characters).
   - Each page has a <meta name="description"> (120–150 characters).
   - A <link rel="canonical" ...> is present.

2. **Content Checks**
   - Each tool page has a 150–200 word SEO content block (<section class="seo-content">).
   - Each tool page and blog includes at least 1–2 FAQs.
   - Blogs are 400–600 words long and include 2+ images with descriptive alt attributes.

3. **Alt Attributes**
   - Every <img> tag includes a non-empty alt attribute.
   - Lazy loading enabled: <img loading="lazy" ...>.

4. **Internal Links**
   - All internal links (tools ↔ blogs) return HTTP 200.
   - Blog index correctly links to all 7 blogs.

5. **Performance**
   - Page load time is under 2 seconds (use Lighthouse or Google PageSpeed check).
   - Ensure no heavy scripts or blocking elements were introduced.

6. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - All pages remain fully responsive.
   - No overlapping content or broken layouts.

7. **Schema Validation**
   - Only 1 FAQPage schema per page.
   - No duplicate structured data warnings.

# 2. REPORT GENERATION
After running all checks, Replit must:
- Produce a **PASS/FAIL report** in the console like this:

SEO Validation Report:
- Meta Tags: PASS
- Alt Attributes: PASS
- Internal Links: PASS
- Performance (Load < 2s): PASS
- Mobile Responsive: PASS
- Schema: PASS

---

# 3. FAILURE HANDLING
- If any test fails:
  - Replit must automatically fix the specific failing component (e.g., missing alt tags, duplicate FAQ schema).
  - Re-run the tests until **100% PASS**.
  - Provide a final PASS report.

---

# 4. RULES
- DO NOT modify any UI styles, gradients, or layouts.
- Only adjust content/SEO elements (meta, alt, internal links, content blocks).
- If a fix would affect UI, prompt the user before applying.

---

# 5. FINAL OUTPUT
- Generate a JSON log of test results and highlight any corrections made.
- Once all tests are PASS, confirm:
  "SEO Validation Complete: Site is AdSense-ready."
