Hi Replit, please implement the following comprehensive updates across the ConvertWiz app (https://www.convertwiz.in) to enhance mobile experience, clean layout issues, and include analytics access for admin users:

---

✅ 1. Fix Layout Padding and Spacing on Mobile:
- Improve spacing/padding on tool cards and buttons for screens ≤ 375px
- Ensure buttons like "Try Now", "Convert", and results are visible and not clipped on mobile

✅ 2. Center Align All Tool Sections:
- Properly center all tool card grids under “Utilities”, “Converters”, “Financial”, etc.
- Remove any duplicate or broken tool placeholders from landing page

✅ 3. Banner Ad Placement Fix:
- On landing page: keep **1 vertical AdSense banner** (on side for desktop, full-width for mobile)
- On sub-tool pages: add **horizontal AdSense banner** at bottom of result section, avoid overlapping content
- Lazy-load AdSense to improve Core Web Vitals (CLS, LCP)

✅ 4. Footer Cleanup:
- Remove “iqbal” from footer — keep only “Ali” branding for now
- Hide Facebook and Instagram links until final URLs are ready

✅ 5. Add Disclaimer for IP Extractor:
- Add a small privacy note below IP result:  
  `"No IP addresses are stored. This tool is 100% privacy-friendly."`

✅ 6. Admin Analytics Dashboard:
- Implement a hidden **/admin-dashboard** route/page
- Show **Google Analytics Realtime Summary** (e.g. current users, page views, top countries, traffic sources) using G-7QJXHFPZVE
- Only allow access to the following admin emails:
   - iqbalaiwork@gmail.com  
   - iqbalbashasi@gmail.com  
   - sajoshaikh@gmail.com  
- If non-admin tries to access: show “Access Denied. Admins only.”
- Add an "Admin" link visible only to logged-in admin users (maybe in the navbar dropdown)

✅ 7. Optimize JS and Image Loading:
- Minify scripts & CSS if possible
- Use lazy loading for images and non-critical sections

These updates will improve design consistency, ensure mobile responsiveness, reduce ad clutter, and give admin-level access to analytics monitoring.

Let me know once done. I will test across all breakpoints and share credentials to validate the admin dashboard.
