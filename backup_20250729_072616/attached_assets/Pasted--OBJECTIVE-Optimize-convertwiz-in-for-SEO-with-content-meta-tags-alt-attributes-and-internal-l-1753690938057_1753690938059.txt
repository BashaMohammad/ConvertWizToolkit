# OBJECTIVE:
Optimize convertwiz.in for SEO with content, meta tags, alt attributes, and internal links.
Replit MUST NOT modify any UI components, gradients, or layouts.

---

# 1. SEO CONTENT UPDATES
For each tool page (JPG to PNG, Image Compressor, Text-to-Speech, Currency Converter, Word Counter):

- Add a 150–200 word SEO content block describing:
  - Purpose of the tool.
  - Why it’s useful.
  - How to use it (step-by-step).
- Insert 1–2 FAQs per page (as given below).
- Ensure meta tags (<title>, <meta description>) are unique and match provided content.
- Add internal links between tools under a small "Explore More Tools" section.

---

# 2. META TAGS & ALT TEXT
- Add descriptive `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` for each page:
  Example (JPG to PNG):
    <title>JPG to PNG Converter – Free Online Tool | ConvertWiz</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Convert JPG to PNG online for free. Fast, secure, and easy-to-use JPG to PNG converter by ConvertWiz.">
- Add `alt` attributes to all `<img>` tags with descriptive text.
- Insert `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.convertwiz.in/{tool-page}" />`.

---

# 3. INTERNAL LINKING
- Add a section like:
  <p>Try our other tools: 
    <a href="/image-compressor.html">Image Compressor</a>, 
    <a href="/text-to-speech.html">Text-to-Speech</a>.
  </p>
- Ensure all links are functional and return HTTP 200.

# 4. TEST CASES (MUST PASS)
Replit must perform these checks after applying the code:

1. **SEO Content Validation**
   - Each tool page contains a new `<section class="seo-content">` with 150–200 words.
   - At least 1–2 FAQs are present with `<h3>` and `<p>` tags.

2. **Meta Tag Validation**
   - Each tool page has a unique `<title>` and `<meta description>` as per provided content.
   - `<link rel="canonical">` is present.

3. **Image Alt Validation**
   - Every `<img>` tag on all tool pages includes a non-empty `alt` attribute.

4. **Internal Link Test**
   - All internal links return HTTP 200 status.

5. **Performance**
   - Page load speed remains <2s (use Lighthouse/Google test).

6. **UI Integrity**
   - Verify that gradients, fonts, and layouts remain unchanged.
   - If any CSS or UI component differs, revert and rebuild.

# 5. FAILURE HANDLING
- If ANY of the above test cases fail:
  - Replit must auto-correct the failed test component.
  - Re-run all test cases until all pass.
  - Provide a test report showing passed/failed status.
