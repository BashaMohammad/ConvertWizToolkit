You need to perform a full cleanup and enhancement of the ConvertWiz project with the following requirements:

### 1. Disable Authentication (All Tools Free)
- Completely remove or bypass Firebase authentication logic across all pages.
- Ensure all tools (JPG to PNG, Image Compressor, Text-to-Speech, etc.) open directly without login or dashboard checks.
- Remove all redirect logic tied to authentication.
- All features should remain accessible while showing “Coming Soon” only for unavailable tools.

### 2. Fix SEO Issues (As Per SiteChecker)
- Add **unique meta titles and descriptions** to every page (e.g., “Convert JPG to PNG Online – Fast & Free”).
- Ensure all images, icons, and logos have **alt attributes**.
- Fix **broken internal links** and 4xx errors by redirecting them to valid pages.
- Improve internal linking between tool pages (e.g., JPG to PNG → Image Compressor).
- Implement **FAQ schema** (without duplicate FAQPage warnings).
- Add **100-150 words of SEO-friendly content** on each tool page explaining its purpose and usage.
- Add **canonical URL tags** for all pages.

### 3. Add Blog Section (SEO Content)
- Create a `/blog` page (blog.html) without altering existing UI styles.
- Add 5 SEO blog placeholders with proper titles and meta tags:
  1. "Top 5 Online Converters You Must Try in 2025"
  2. "How to Compress PDFs Without Losing Quality"
  3. "Fast Image Conversion Tips for Beginners"
  4. "The Ultimate Guide to Text-to-Speech Tools"
  5. "Why ConvertWiz is Your All-in-One Tool Hub"
- Each blog should have at least **400+ words** of placeholder content optimized for SEO.

### 4. Performance & Accessibility
- Compress and optimize static assets (images, CSS, JS) but **do not alter visual UI elements.**
- Enable **lazy loading** for large images.
- Ensure **mobile responsiveness** is fully functional.

### 5. Test Cases for Replit (Validation)

**Functional Tests:**
1. Access homepage → All tools must be accessible without login.
2. Test all tool pages → Ensure they open and work properly.
3. Test `/blog` → Ensure all 5 blogs are visible and accessible.

**SEO Tests:**
4. Verify unique `<title>` and `<meta>` descriptions on every page.
5. Confirm all images have `alt` attributes.
6. Check that FAQ schema is implemented without duplicates.
7. Verify canonical tags are present.

**Performance Tests:**
8. Validate that page load time is <2 seconds.
9. Ensure lazy loading for images.
10. Test mobile responsiveness (no UI overlaps or broken elements).

### Important Conditions:
- **NO UI structure or gradient changes are allowed.**
- Only backend, SEO, and content enhancements should be made.
- Replit must confirm all test cases are passed and share a summary.
