# Git Deployment Instructions for ConvertWiz

## Current Status
✅ Static deployment structure complete
✅ All files moved to public/ directory  
✅ vercel.json configuration added
✅ Server updated to serve from public/
✅ All 18+ conversion tools functional

## Manual Git Commands Required

Since there are merge conflicts with the remote repository, please run these commands manually in the terminal:

### Step 1: Pull Remote Changes
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Step 2: Add All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Static deployment optimization: moved frontend to public/, added vercel.json, restored full functionality"
```

### Step 4: Push to Remote
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (if conflicts persist)
If merge conflicts are too complex, you can force push:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
