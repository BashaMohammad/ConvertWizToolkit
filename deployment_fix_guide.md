# ConvertWiz Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Identified
- 404 NOT_FOUND error on Vercel deployment
- Full-stack app incorrectly deployed as static site
- Backend server.js not properly configured for Vercel

## Root Cause
ConvertWiz is a full-stack application with:
- Node.js Express server (server.js)
- Frontend files in public/ directory
- API endpoints for tools
- Database connections

But Vercel was treating it as a static-only deployment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "public/**/*",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/server.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/public/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Current Deployment Status
- Local server working: http://localhost:5000/ (200 OK)
- All 18+ tools functional locally
- Public directory structure optimized
- Git repository updated with latest changes

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Delete current deployment
3. Create new deployment from GitHub
4. Ensure it detects as Node.js app (not static)

### Option 2: Alternative - Replit Deployments
Since you're already on Replit, you can use Replit's deployment:
1. Use Replit's built-in deployment feature
2. Configure as Autoscale Deployment (not Static)
3. Will handle Node.js + static files automatically

### Option 3: Check Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- DATABASE_URL (if using PostgreSQL)
- Any other environment variables from your .env

## Verification
After deployment, check:
- Main page loads without 404
- All conversion tools accessible
- API endpoints working (/api/health)
- Database connections active

## Files Ready for Deployment
- server.js (Express backend)
- public/ directory (all frontend files)
- vercel.json (proper full-stack config)
- All dependencies in package.json
