# 1. Firebase Initialization Check
- Verify that Firebase SDK is included in the project. 
- Ensure that the Firebase configuration (apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.) is correctly added in your JavaScript file.
- Check if Firebase Authentication is properly initialized using `firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)`.

# 2. User Registration Flow Confirmation
- Confirm that email/password registration functionality is working.
  - Ensure that the form is set up to capture email and password.
  - Verify that `firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)` is being used for user registration.
- Check if Google Sign-In integration is enabled.
  - Confirm that Google authentication is set up and users can register using Google.

# 3. User Authentication Check
- Confirm that the app uses `firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged()` to handle user login and check if the user is authenticated.
- Ensure that the user information (e.g., email or Google account details) is captured after authentication.

# 4. Subscription Handling via Firebase Firestore (if applicable)
- Check if Firestore is set up to track user subscriptions.
  - Verify that user subscription data (e.g., "free", "paid") is stored in Firestore.
  - Ensure that subscription status is updated after registration (or payment).
- Confirm that user data is being saved in Firestore under `users` collection with proper fields like `subscriptionStatus` and `planType`.

# 5. Stripe or PayPal Integration for Paid Subscriptions (if applicable)
- If using **Stripe/PayPal**, ensure that the integration code is included and functional.
  - Verify that subscription payments are being processed correctly and Firestore is updated post-payment.
  
# 6. Testing the Flow
- Confirm that:
  - Registration via email and password works successfully.
  - Google sign-in works as expected.
  - Subscription status is updated in Firestore after registration (or payment).
  - No errors are thrown in the console related to Firebase Authentication or Firestore.

# 7. Debugging
- Check the browser console for any errors or warnings related to Firebase Authentication or Firestore.
- Ensure that Firebase Authentication and Firestore settings are correctly configured in the Firebase Console.

# If all of the above items are completed and working, the User Registration & Subscription Integration is properly set up.
