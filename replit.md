Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
ConvertWiz employs a full-stack architecture with a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend utilizing the Canvas API for image processing, and a Node.js Express backend integrated with Firebase Admin SDK. The system uses client-side calculations enhanced by backend APIs.

**Core Architectural Decisions:**
- **Client-Side Routing:** Single-page application design with JavaScript-based routing for smooth navigation between tool pages.
- **Modular Design:** Each tool operates with isolated logic to prevent interference, ensuring consistent branding and navigation.
- **Hybrid Processing:** Leverages client-side processing for immediate feedback, complemented by backend APIs for complex or data-intensive operations (e.g., image compression, enhanced calculations).
- **Security & Scalability:** Firebase Admin SDK for secure server-side operations, Firestore for usage tracking and user data, and robust authentication with email/password and Google OAuth.
- **UI/UX Philosophy:** Professional SaaS-style landing page with categorized tool showcase, responsive grid layouts, sticky navigation, and consistent branding. Design emphasizes clean aesthetics, clear functionality, and mobile responsiveness with professional color schemes (e.g., cyan/teal for Distance, purple/violet for Weight, indigo/blue for Height). Glass morphism effects and gradients are used extensively for a modern look.
- **Performance Optimization:** CDN usage for libraries, client-side processing to reduce server load, lazy loading, and optimized asset delivery contribute to fast loading times.
- **Monetization Strategy:** Integrated Google AdSense with strategic, non-intrusive ad placements and a subscription system (Free, Standard, Premium tiers) managed via Firebase and a dedicated webhook server for payment confirmations.
- **Admin & Analytics:** Comprehensive admin dashboard with real-time analytics, user management, and activity monitoring using Chart.js for visualization, accessible to authorized administrators.
- **Legal Compliance:** Inclusion of dedicated legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Disclaimer, Credits) and a cookie consent banner.
