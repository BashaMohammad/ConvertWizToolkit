CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED – COMPONENT ROUTING ISSUE:

The current app is broken. All tool components (JPG to PNG, Currency Converter, Image Compressor, Word Counter, Distance Converter, etc.) are displayed together on every page. I want to restore the correct component-based behavior **without changing the UI or gradients.**

### Required Fixes:

1. **Component Isolation:**
   - Each tool must load independently on its dedicated page or section.
   - When a user visits `/jpg-to-png.html`, ONLY the JPG to PNG converter should be visible.
   - Similarly, `/currency-converter.html` should show ONLY the Currency Converter.
   - Hide all other tools by default using `display: none;`.

2. **Navigation Logic:**
   - Fix the JavaScript routing logic (in `main.js` or equivalent).
   - Ensure navigation links and menu buttons load only their specific content.
   - Correct any broken `onclick` or `hashchange` handlers if SPA logic is used.

3. **HTML Cleanup:**
   - If all components were mistakenly injected into `index.html`, split them into separate sections or files again.
   - Use proper `<section id="tool-name">` wrappers to toggle visibility.

4. **UI Preservation:**
   - Do not change any CSS, gradients, or layout.
   - Keep the current gradient design and 24-hour-old UI structure as-is.

5. **Automated Test Cases:**
   After applying the fix, Replit must run the following tests:
   - **Test 1:** Open `/index.html` → Only tool grid should be visible, NOT all components.
   - **Test 2:** Open `/jpg-to-png.html` → Only JPG to PNG converter should be visible.
   - **Test 3:** Open `/currency-converter.html` → Only Currency Converter is visible.
   - **Test 4:** Navigate between tools (menu clicks) and confirm correct page load.
   - **Test 5:** Confirm no broken links, all routes return HTTP 200.

6. **Backup Before Fixing:**
   - Create a backup of `index.html`, `main.js`, and `style.css` before applying changes.

### Final Requirement:
Deliver a **clean, fully working app** where each tool appears independently, navigation works perfectly, and no components overlap. Confirm all test cases pass automatically.
