   - FileReader API processes the file
   - Canvas element handles conversion
   - Result displayed with download option

2. **Conversion Process:**
   - Image loaded into canvas element
   - Format conversion performed using canvas.toDataURL()
   - New image generated and displayed
   - Download link created using blob URLs
