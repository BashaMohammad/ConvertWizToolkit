# Google AdSense Integration Setup Instructions for ConvertWiz

## Overview
ConvertWiz now includes comprehensive Google AdSense integration for monetization through strategic, non-intrusive ad placements. This document provides complete setup instructions for configuring AdSense in your application.

## Prerequisites
- Google AdSense account with approved publisher status
- Admin access to Google AdSense dashboard
- ConvertWiz application already deployed to production domain

## Step 1: AdSense Account Setup

1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Add your production website domain (your .replit.app domain or custom domain)
4. Wait for site approval (can take 1-14 days)
5. Once approved, you'll receive your Publisher ID

## Step 2: Get Your AdSense Configuration

1. In AdSense dashboard, go to **"Ads"** → **"By site"**
2. Select your approved website
3. Copy your **Publisher ID** (format: `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)
4. Create ad units or use auto ads (recommended for responsive design)
5. If using specific ad units, copy the **Ad Slot IDs**

## Step 3: Configure ConvertWiz AdSense Integration

### Update Publisher ID

1. Open `index.html` in your ConvertWiz project
2. Find all instances of `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXX` (there are multiple locations)
3. Replace with your actual Publisher ID

**Locations to update:**
- AdSense script in `<head>` section
- All `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` elements throughout the page

### Update Ad Slot IDs (Optional)

1. Find all instances of `data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXX"`
2. Replace with your specific ad slot IDs
3. Or keep as `XXXXXXXXX` to use auto ads (recommended)

### Production vs Development Configuration

The integration automatically handles environment detection:

- **Development Mode** (localhost): Shows placeholder ads only
- **Production Mode** (deployed): Shows real AdSense ads

## Step 4: Ad Placement Strategy

ConvertWiz uses strategic, non-intrusive ad placement:

### Current Ad Locations:

1. **Homepage - After Tools Showcase**
   - Location: Between tool grid and "Why Choose ConvertWiz?" section
   - Type: Responsive banner ad
   - Visibility: High engagement area

2. **After JPG to PNG Converter**
   - Location: Between converter section and next tool
   - Type: Responsive rectangular ad
   - Context: Post-conversion engagement

3. **After Currency Converter**
   - Location: Below conversion results and disclaimer
   - Type: Auto-responsive ad unit
   - Context: After successful conversion

4. **Above Footer - Global**
   - Location: Site-wide, before footer on all pages
   - Type: Large responsive banner
   - Visibility: Natural end-of-content placement

### Ad Characteristics:
- **Responsive Design**: All ads adapt to screen size
- **Non-blocking**: Lazy loading and error handling
- **Performance Optimized**: Conditional loading based on environment
- **User-Friendly**: Strategic placement that doesn't interrupt workflow

## Step 5: Testing Your AdSense Integration

### Development Testing:
1. Run your application locally
2. Verify placeholder ads display in development mode
3. Check browser console for AdSense script loading (should show loading errors - this is expected)

### Production Testing:
1. Deploy to your production domain
2. Wait 15-30 minutes for ads to populate
3. Check that real ads display instead of placeholders
4. Monitor AdSense dashboard for impression data

## Step 6: Performance Optimization

### Built-in Optimizations:

1. **Conditional Loading**: AdSense script only loads in production
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if ads fail to load
3. **Lazy Loading**: Ads initialize after page load with 1-second delay
4. **Responsive Units**: All ads automatically adjust to device size

### CSS Classes for Customization:

```css
.ad-container                 /* Main ad wrapper */
.adsbygoogle                 /* Production ad element */
.ad-placeholder              /* Development placeholder */
body[data-env="development"] /* Development mode targeting */
```

## Step 7: Monitoring and Analytics

### AdSense Dashboard Metrics:
- Page RPM (Revenue per thousand impressions)
- CTR (Click-through rate)
- CPC (Cost per click)
- Total earnings

### Google Analytics Integration:
ConvertWiz includes Google Analytics (G-7QJXHFPZVE) which provides:
- User behavior data
- Page engagement metrics
- Conversion funnel analysis
- Ad performance correlation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Ads not showing in production**
   - Verify Publisher ID is correct
   - Check domain is approved in AdSense
   - Wait 30 minutes after deployment
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **"No slot size for availableWidth=0" error**
   - This is normal in development mode
   - Indicates script is working but container has no width
   - Not an issue in production

3. **Low ad fill rate**
   - Ensure content is family-friendly
   - Check AdSense policy compliance
   - Monitor for invalid click activity
   - Consider enabling backup ads

### Debug Steps:

1. Open browser Developer Tools → Console
2. Look for AdSense-related messages
3. Check Network tab for blocked requests
4. Verify ad containers have proper dimensions

## Revenue Optimization Tips

1. **Content Quality**: High-quality, original content attracts premium ads
2. **User Engagement**: Longer session times improve ad performance  
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure ads display well on all devices
4. **Page Speed**: Fast loading times improve ad viewability
5. **Strategic Placement**: Balance user experience with ad visibility
